### Step 1 - Implementation:

- Implement a linear search and binary search algorithm for a list of integers.
- Implement a dictionary-based search for the same data.

### Step 2 - Experimentation:

- Create lists of random integers of varying sizes (e.g., 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000).
- Perform searches for random target numbers using both the linear search, binary search, and dictionary-based search.

### Step 3 - Data Collection:

- For each input size, record the time taken for each search algorithm (linear, binary, and dictionary-based search).
- Run multiple experiments (at least 5 times per input size) to account for variability in search times.

### Step 4 - Data Analysis:

- Calculate the average time taken for each search algorithm at each input size.
- Analyze how the performance of the algorithms changes as the input size grows.

### Step 5 - Engineering Judgment and Conclusions:

- Based on your data, use engineering judgment to determine under what circumstances each search method is most effective.
- Discuss why binary search is more efficient on sorted lists, and why dictionary searches outperform both list-based searches for certain tasks.
- Include a conclusion discussing your analysis and the conditions under which each algorithm should be used.
